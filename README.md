React App

This application is made with react.js technologies. The application creates a news webpage with multiple functionalities:
* The whole application is responsive.
* The homepage features has six news articles from each category, along with a favorites section accessible from the header. 
* Each news article is presented within a card. The details for each article - title, description and image - have been generated using The Guardian's API. 
* The favorites section allows us to bookmark our favorite articles for easier access, as each news category contains many articles spread across multiple pages for easier navigation.

To run this project made with react you must clone the repo and use the following commands:

* npm install / npm i
* npm start
